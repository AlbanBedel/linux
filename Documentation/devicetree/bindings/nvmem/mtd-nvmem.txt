= NVMEM in MTD =

Config data for drivers, like MAC addresses, is often stored in MTD.
An MTD device, or one of its partition, can be defined as a NVMEM provider
by having an 'nvmem-cells' subnode as defined in nvmem.txt.

Example:

	flash@0 {
		...

		partition@2 {
			label = "art";
			reg = <0x7F0000 0x010000>;
			read-only;

			nvmem-cells {
				compatible = "nvmem-cells";
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <1>;

				eeprom@1000 {
					reg = <0x1000 0x1000>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
